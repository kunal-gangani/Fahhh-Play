Place your `mouth_sound.mp3` audio file in this directory. The audio will be played when the user opens their mouth.

## How to add your audio file:
1. Export or find an audio file in MP3 format (or WAV/AAC)
2. Place it in this `assets` directory with the name `mouth_sound.mp3`
3. The app will automatically play this audio when mouth opening is detected
